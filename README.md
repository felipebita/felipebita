## Education and Research
I have a [bachelor's degree](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pI8eVAobot_1tvGbaeYL_SpZDoFVsdbc/view?usp=sharing) in Biological Science (State University of Campinas - UNICAMP) and I'm currently working on my PhD in [Genetics and Molecular Biology](https://site2.ib.unicamp.br/pos_genetica_molec/en/node/129) (State University of Campinas - UNICAMP). As an undergraduate student I had a FAPESP research scholarship to accomplish a project in the [Laboratory of Genetic and Molecular Analysis](https://lagm.cbmeg.unicamp.br/en/index.html) where I investigated single copy genes in sugarcane using bioinformatic tools. In the same laboratory I started my PhD studying plant breeding, more specifically molecular breeding methods and tools for polyploid species. During this time I acquired abilities to obtain, manipulate and analyze genetic and common data using programming and statistics. Furthermore, I have been studying Machine Learning algorithms to enhance plant breeding results and resolve business problems.

#### Tools
* **Operating system:** Unix(Linux, centOS, macOS) and Windows

* **Data Processing, Analytics and Visualization:** SQL, Python and R.

* **Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression and Clustering.

## Projects

* ### [A Semi-Automated SNP-Based Approach for Contaminant Identification in Biparental Polyploid Populations of Tropical Forage Grasses](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.737919/full)

    Artificial hybridization plays a fundamental role in plant breeding programs since it generates new genotypic combinations that can result in desirable phenotypes. Depending on the species and mode of reproduction, controlled crosses may be challenging, and contaminating individuals can be introduced accidentally. In this context, the identification of such contaminants is important to avoid compromising further selection cycles, as well as genetic and genomic studies. The main objective of this work was to propose an automated multivariate methodology for the detection and classification of putative contaminants, including apomictic clones, self-fertilized individuals, half-siblings and full contaminants, in biparental polyploid progenies of tropical forage grasses. We established a pipeline to identify contaminants in **genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)** data encoded as **allele dosages of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)** markers by integrating **principal component analysis (PCA)**, genotypic analysis (GA) measures based on Mendelian segregation and **clustering analysis (CA)**. The combination of these methods allowed the correct identification of all contaminants in all simulated progenies and the detection of putative contaminants in three real progenies of tropical forage grasses, providing an easy and promising methodology for the identification of contaminants in biparental progenies of tetraploid and hexaploid species. The proposed pipeline was made available through the <a href="https://github.com/lagmunicamp/polycid" target="_blank">**polyCID**</a> Shiny app and can be easily coupled with traditional genetic approaches, such as linkage map construction, thereby increasing the efficiency of breeding programs.

    
* ### [Fraudulent Transaction Detection](https://github.com/felipebita/fraud_detection)
    Financial institutions are facing problems when dealing with fraudulent transactions. Those transactions not only reduces the institution revenue but also its credibility. In this scenario, the Block Fraud Company offers a service that ensures the blocking of fraud transactions. The methodology developed by the BFC is based on machine learning algorithms for classification, the implemented model has a precision of 0.958 +/- 0.013 and a recall of 0.744 +/- 0.037. Considering the company expansion strategy and the model capacity, for a set of 120.000 transactions, the service would generate a total revenue of $39.309.131, with a mean profit of $330,00 per transaction analyzed.
