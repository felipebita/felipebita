## Education and Research
I have a [bachelor's degree](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pI8eVAobot_1tvGbaeYL_SpZDoFVsdbc/view?usp=sharing) in Biological Sciences (State University of Campinas - UNICAMP) and I'm currently working on my PhD in [Genetics and Molecular Biology](https://site2.ib.unicamp.br/pos_genetica_molec/en/node/129) (State University of Campinas - UNICAMP). As an undergraduate student I had a FAPESP research scholarship to accomplish a project in the [Laboratory of Genetic and Molecular Analysis](https://lagm.cbmeg.unicamp.br/en/index.html) where I investigated single copy genes in sugarcane using bioinformatic tools. In the same laboratory I started my PhD studying plant breeding, more specifically molecular breeding methods and tools for polyploid species. During this time I acquired abilities to obtain, manipulate and analyze genetic and common data using programming and statistics. Furthermore, I have been studying Machine Learning algorithms to enhance plant breeding results and resolve business problems.

## Scientific Production and Projects

* ### [Insights into the Regulation of Agronomic Traits in _U. ruziziensis_ Through Multi-omics Data Integration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EQoMBI_S97q8Ij12aUPFb-UAPekSEIcZ/view?usp=sharing)

    The complete manuscript is not finished, it will be available when submited as pre-print to bioRxiv.
    Tropical forage grasses, especially species of the genus Urochloa, play an important role in cattle production being the main food source for the animals in the tropical/subtropical regions. Most of the species are apomictic and tetraploid, this give special importance to U. ruziziensis, a sexual diploid species that can be tetraploidized to be used in interspecific crosses with apomitic species. As a means to auxiliate breeding programs, this study investigates the applicability of **genome wide family prediction (GWFP)** in U. ruziziensis half-sibling families to predict growth and biomass production. **Machine learning** and **feature selection algorithms** were used to reduce the number of markers necessary for prediction to approximately 11 markers and to enhance the predictive ability to approximately 0.9 across the phenotypes. Beyond that, to investigate the regulation of the agronomic traits, the position of the markers with more importance for the prediction were considered as putative QTLs, and in a **multi-omic approach**, genes obtained in the species transcriptome were mapped linked to those markers. Furthermore, a **gene co-expression network** was constructed enabling not only the investigation of the mapped genes but their co-expressed genes too. The functional annotation showed that the mapped genes are mainly associated with auxin transport and biosynthesis of lignin, flavonol and folic acid, while the co-expressed genes are associated with DNA metabolism, stress response and circadian rhythm. These results provide a viable marker-assisted breeding approach for tropical forages and identify target regions for future molecular studies on agronomic traits.
        
* ### [A Semi-Automated SNP-Based Approach for Contaminant Identification in Biparental Polyploid Populations of Tropical Forage Grasses](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.737919/full)

    Artificial hybridization plays a fundamental role in plant breeding programs since it generates new genotypic combinations that can result in desirable phenotypes.  Depending on the species and mode of reproduction, controlled crosses may be challenging, and contaminating individuals can be introduced accidentally. In this context, the identification of such contaminants is important to avoid compromising further selection cycles, as well as genetic and genomic studies. The main objective of this work was to propose an automated multivariate methodology for the detection and classification of putative contaminants, including apomictic clones, self-fertilized individuals, half-siblings and full contaminants, in biparental polyploid progenies of tropical forage grasses. We established a pipeline to identify contaminants in **genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)** data encoded as **allele dosages of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)** markers by integrating **principal component analysis (PCA)**, genotypic analysis (GA) measures based on Mendelian segregation and **clustering analysis (CA)**. The combination of these methods allowed the correct identification of all contaminants in all simulated progenies and the detection of putative contaminants in three real progenies of tropical forage grasses, providing an easy and promising methodology for the identification of contaminants in biparental progenies of tetraploid and hexaploid species. The proposed pipeline was made available through the <a href="https://github.com/lagmunicamp/polycid" target="_blank">**polyCID**</a> Shiny app and can be easily coupled with traditional genetic approaches, such as linkage map construction, thereby increasing the efficiency of breeding programs.

    
* ### [Fraudulent Transaction Detection](https://github.com/felipebita/fraud_detection)
    Financial institutions are facing problems when dealing with fraudulent transactions. Those transactions not only reduces the institution revenue but also its credibility. In this scenario, the Block Fraud Company offers a service that ensures the blocking of fraud transactions. The methodology developed by the BFC is based on machine learning algorithms for classification, the implemented model has a precision of 0.961 +/- 0.021 and a recall of 0.729 +/- 0.026. Considering the company expansion strategy and the model capacity, for a set of 52.185 transactions, the service would generate a total revenue of $57.260.473.
