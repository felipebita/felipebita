## Data Science Projects

* ### [polyCID](https://github.com/lagmunicamp/polycid)

    polyCID is a user-friendly R shiny app based on preprocessed GBS data for detection and classification of putative contaminants in biparental polyploid populations, including apomictic clones, self-fertilization, half-siblings and/or full contaminants individuals. You can explore our simulated data to learn how to interact with the tool, as well as access, modify all datasets and adapt them to your research needs. By going through the workflow below, you will become familiar with all the steps involved in the analysis

    
* ### [Transaction Fraud Detection](https://github.com/juniorcl/transaction-fraud-detection)

    Financial transactions fraud is one of the biggest problems faced by financial institutions. Thus, this project uses data science and machine learning to detect and avoid fraudulent transactions. The model got a precision of 96.3% +/- 0.7% and a recall of 76.3% +/- 3.5%. The profit expected by the company is R\$ 57,251,574.44.
