## Scientific Projects  

* ### [Genome-wide Family Prediction Unveils Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Regulation of Agronomic Traits in Urochloa ruziziensis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1303417/full) [(Flowchart)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EQoMBI_S97q8Ij12aUPFb-UAPekSEIcZ/view?usp=sharing) (ML, Networks, R, Python)
 
    Tropical forage grasses, especially species of the genus Urochloa, play an important role in cattle production and are the main food source for animals in tropical/subtropical regions. Most of the species are apomictic and tetraploid, which gives special importance to U. ruziziensis, a sexual diploid species that can be tetraploidized for use in interspecific crosses with apomictic species. As a means to assist in breeding programs, this study investigates the applicability of **genome-wide family prediction** (GWFP) in U. ruziziensis half-sibling families to predict growth and biomass production. **Machine learning** and **feature selection** algorithms were used to reduce the necessary number of markers for prediction and to enhance the predictive ability across the phenotypes. Beyond that, to investigate the regulation of agronomic traits, the positions of the markers with more importance for the prediction were considered putatively associated to quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and in a **multiomic approach**, genes obtained in the species transcriptome were mapped and linked to those markers. Furthermore, a **gene coexpression network** was modeled, enabling the investigation of not only the mapped genes but also their coexpressed genes. The functional annotation showed that the mapped genes are mainly associated with auxin transport and biosynthesis of lignin, flavonol and folic acid, while the coexpressed genes are associated with DNA metabolism, stress response and circadian rhythm. The results provide a viable marker-assisted breeding approach for tropical forages and identify target regions for future molecular studies on these agronomic traits.
        
* ### [A Semi-Automated SNP-Based Approach for Contaminant Identification in Biparental Polyploid Populations of Tropical Forage Grasses](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.737919/full) (ML, R)

    Artificial hybridization plays a fundamental role in plant breeding programs since it generates new genotypic combinations that can result in desirable phenotypes.  Depending on the species and mode of reproduction, controlled crosses may be challenging, and contaminating individuals can be introduced accidentally. In this context, the identification of such contaminants is important to avoid compromising further selection cycles, as well as genetic and genomic studies. The main objective of this work was to propose an automated multivariate methodology for the detection and classification of putative contaminants, including apomictic clones, self-fertilized individuals, half-siblings and full contaminants, in biparental polyploid progenies of tropical forage grasses. We established a pipeline to identify contaminants in **genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)** data encoded as **allele dosages of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)** markers by integrating **principal component analysis (PCA)**, genotypic analysis (GA) measures based on Mendelian segregation and **clustering analysis (CA)**. The combination of these methods allowed the correct identification of all contaminants in all simulated progenies and the detection of putative contaminants in three real progenies of tropical forage grasses, providing an easy and promising methodology for the identification of contaminants in biparental progenies of tetraploid and hexaploid species. The proposed pipeline was made available through the <a href="https://github.com/lagmunicamp/polycid" target="_blank">**polyCID**</a> Shiny app and can be easily coupled with traditional genetic approaches, such as linkage map construction, thereby increasing the efficiency of breeding programs.

* ### [Identifiation and Characterization of Single-copy Genes in Sugarcane](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c-63U-wq48xj2Wsdd207UgMiOL8oI_U6/view) (Bioinformatics)
    A cana-de-açúcar por ser a principal fonte de produção sucroalcooleira é uma espécie de grande importância econômica, por isso, muitos esforços vêm sendo feitos para compreender seu complexo genoma e auxiliar programas de melhoramento. Este relatório descreve as atividades que tiveram por objetivo identificar genes candidatos a cópia única em cana-de-açúcar, genes esses que são de grande utilidade na construção de mapas genéticos e na análise de expressão gênica. A primeira estratégia para identificar esses genes foi encontrar os genes de cópia única compartilhados entre arroz, milho e sorgo e identificar as sequências equivalentes no transcriptoma da cana-de-açúcar. Partindo dos genes de cana foi feito o mapeamento de transcritos de diferentes tecidos do organismo e o ranqueamento pela proporção polimorfismos/tamanho, e então foram mapeados 219 genes dos quais 26 tiveram menos de 5pol./1kbs, os 219 genes passaram por anotação funcional utilizando os termos GO (Gene Ontology), sendo agrupados pelo processo biológico e função molecular. A segunda estratégia foi utilizar sequências do transcriptoma que apresentaram ORFs completas e não estavam presentes nos CDS de arroz, milho e sorgo, sendo consideradas como novos genes. Esses genes (1.712) também foram utilizados no mapeamento de transcritos, apenas 394 genes foram mapeados e puderam ser ranqueados, os resultados se mostraram promissores, 29 genes tiveram até 1 pol./1kb e 127 genes até 5 pol./1kb.

    This lecture was ministered in the [BV782 - Plant Genetics and Genomics - 1S/2020](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/portal/caderno-de-horarios/2020/1/S/G/IB/BV782) class for the Biological Sciences course at UNICAMP. It is an introduction about Genomic Selection, passing through the famous Meuwissen (2001) article which demonstrate the applicability of dense sets of genetic markers to predict breeding values, how Genomic Selection models are evaluted (Predictive Ability and Cross Validation) and part of my research regarding genomic selection in half-siblings families of *Urochloa ruziziensis* tropical forage.
    
* ### Genetic Markers [(slides)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jXof4E6BPAY00_-0V_jWP3NAH1zdsNeK/view?usp=sharing)(pt-br)
    This slide presentation was used in a lecture ministered in the [BV880 - Plant Breeding - 2S/2019](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/portal/caderno-de-horarios/2019/2/S/G/IB/BV880) class for the Biological Sciences course at UNICAMP. It is an introduction about markers (morphological and molecular) with focus on molecular markers,especially the DNA markers. It covers the most common markers (microsatellite and SNP) and it's use in linkage maps and QTL mapping.

* ### Linear Regression [(slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R6fViHULsb0LGOy7FC9hUny7v4ktDfaD/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106210785402829867900&rtpof=true&sd=true)(en)
    This presentation was constructed as a scheme for my own studies and latter used to teach lab colleagues. It covers the three main topics about Linear Regressions: (1) fit a line to the data; (2) calculate the R² and (3) calculate de F-test.
